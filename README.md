# <Your-Weather-Dashboard>

## Description

In this project I was tasked with creating an application that could allow users to monitor current and future weather conditions for a desired city. I built this to practice affectively fetching data from a server-side API and dynamically appending specific data values to the webpage. This helped me to piece together everything I have learned into one weather dashboard application.

## Usage

You can find the new live application at https://ajsherrill2.github.io/Your-Weather-Dashboard/

Upon loading the application the user will see two boxes in the main display, first a search form then a recent searches container. The User can type in desired city and by either clicking the search button or hitting enter on keyboard, a current weather and five day forcast will display. In the current weather display the user is given current date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. The user is also provided with a five day forcast, inlcuding the date, and weather averages for that given day. When a city is searched a new button will appear in the recent searches section and the user can use this to quickly retrieve weather data without having to type there desired city into the search form again.

If the User types in a value that does not appear in the available city library an alert will prompt the user.
